🧠 What I Learned
This project was a major personal breakthrough. Some key lessons:

Understanding React’s structure: Components, JSX, props, imports.

Fixing image-related issues: I learned how to properly import and use images within React.

Using VSCode’s terminal: Speeds up workflow drastically compared to switching between tabs.

Debugging rendering issues: A simple browser restart fixed a major issue. Sometimes, the solution is simpler than expected.

Asking for help: I reached out to a mentor in the Scrimba community, which helped me move past a mental block.

Styling in a React context: Realized how second-nature CSS has become for me.

📘 A Note from Me
This wasn't the hardest project technically, but it was the most important. It marked my return to flow after a long stretch of learning friction. What made it special was not just the code — but the momentum it gave me. That’s what made it worth building.
